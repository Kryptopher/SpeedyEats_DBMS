# SpeedyEats_DBMS
This is a repository for a project for LSU CS4102- DBMS class 2024
Code Content:  
1. Database relations with constraints (2 points). You must submit the database file(s) 
based on the chosen platform. You can use any relational database management 
system to create your database. We highly recommend either SQLite or MySQL.  
2. Data (2 points). Your database file must contain data and not just schemas. We do not 
expect you to use real data. Feel free to generate synthetic data using a script. You 
must provide the script if you choose to do so.  
3. Test queries (2 points). You will have to provide us with a set of 5 test queries to 
check if your database is working as expected. The test queries must be provided in 
an executable file.  
4. Application user interfaces (2 points). You will need to provide the code for your 
application user interfaces. There are no restrictions on the platform you can use.  
5. Readme/Instructions (2 points): You must provide us with detailed documentation on 
how to run your database, application user interface code and execute test queries. 
Note that if we are unable to run your code, you will only be partially graded.
